# My Homepage
This is the repository of my personal homepage. It was written in React. If you question my frontend framework choice ... it's because React was the framework I was the least familiar with at the time. A simple home page might not even need a full blown framework -> but it makes writing it more fun :)

# Hosting
The web page is hosted on github using github pages.
The backend is hosted on a Free Dyno on Heroku.

# Deployment
## Webpage
The homepage can be built and directly deployed using the following command:
`npm run deploy`

## API
Automatic deplyoment is activated on Heroku.  
Every change to the master branch gets published right away.
